## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To clone and run this application, you'll need Git, Node.js and npm install. You can also use an alternative package manager, such as Yarn if you prefer!

```
# Clone the repo
git clone ssh://git@github.com:mfarrow701/wxjet-notifications-service.git

# Install dependencies

```

Once you have ensured that the service is up and running (by navigating to http://localhost:3001/) spin up a copy of WxJet to see the magic happen!
